## Collections
Collections are data structures that store group of related objects.
Unlike arrays, they are dynamic (can grow or shrink) and provide powerful methods to manage data efficiently.

### C# provides two major categories:
#### Non-Generic Collections (Old, less type-safe): From System.Collections
- ArrayList
- Hashtable
- Stack
- Queue

#### Generic Collections (Modern, type-safe): From System.Collections.Generic
- List<T>
- Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
- Queue<T>
- Stack<T>
- HashSet<T>
